# BusinessForecasting

This repository shows various Forecasting Techniques and Statistical Methods 
using Excel taught in my Business Forecasting class. 

Learning how to forecast is critical to anticipate future data by using 
prior historical data. This is beneficial for a number of key business indicators
such as Demand, Sales, Prices, and much more. 

The basis of these techniques are rooted in statistical inference. Excel helps 
simplify the meticilous work through data analysis functions such as Regression 
Analysis and Matrix Correlation. However, understanding how to construct the data 
is crucial to maximizing productive information. Tests such as Autocorrelation, 
Dummy Variable Analysis, Time-Series Analysis, and Seasonal-Index Analysis are 
dependent on how the data is structured.
